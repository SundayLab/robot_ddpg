# What is this ?
this ddpg agent is based on keras_rl. When it comes to "envs" OpenAI is the way to go. Keras-rl works with openai gyms out of the box. Here we have a custom gym-env that communicates via websockets with a unity based robotsimulation.

## Getting Started

just start the robot_ddpgagent.py and let it happen....

### Prerequisites

- TBA

### Dependencies

If you want to see the agent performing in the usecase i build it for you need the following software..

- TBA 

### Installing

You do need a small number of libraries.

  - keras_rl
  - numpy
  - gym
 
## Acknowledgments

This solution works perfectly in combination with some stuff i've built and its a nice demonstrator for a distributed machine learning pipleline with async websocket communication.
